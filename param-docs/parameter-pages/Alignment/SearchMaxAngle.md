# Parameter `SearchMaxAngle`
Default Value: `45`

Unit: degree

!!! Warning
    This is an **Expert Parameter**! Only change it if you understand what it does!

Angle, by which the reference is max rotated when searching.

!!! Note
     Since the alignment is one of the steps using a lot of computation time, 
     the max angle should be as small as possible.
     The calculation time goes quadratic with the angle.
